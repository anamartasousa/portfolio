Hello!

My name is Ana Marta and I'm a digital product and graphic designer.

As a kid you could always find me drawing, painting or coming up with very glittery crafting projects, and so I decided to bring this passion into adulthood and pursue an education in Design. This has allowed me to explore all these artistic interests in depth and turn them into skills I can use in the real world.

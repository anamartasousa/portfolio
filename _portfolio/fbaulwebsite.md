summary: FBAUL website redesign - Case Study
---

This project aimed at improving the students' experience on the university website. We had data from previous years investigation to work with and also conducted our own.

The website's entire information hierarchy and sitemap were redesigned and the university's existing brand guidelines were implemented onto a new design system, created based on user's current needs and desires.

# Ana Marta

Hey :)

I'm Ana Marta, a <strong>digital product</strong> and graphic <strong>designer</strong>.

As a kid you could always find me drawing, painting or coming up with very glittery crafting projects, and so I decided to bring this passion into adulthood and pursue an education in Design. This has allowed me to explore all these artistic interests in depth and turn them into skills I can use in the real world.
